# Getting Started with React-Redux and Redux-Saga

In this application, I will showcase React-Redux and Redux-Saga
## Store
Global state accessible through out the whole application

## Action
Define what needs to be done

## Reducer
How action changes from one state to another
Checks which action is called and modifies the store

## Dispatch
Dispatch actions and trigger state changes to the store.
